# ATTENTION
If you're reading this, the repo recently had a big update that might break current installs, and makes some sections of the readme inaccurate. You no longer need to edit the `.env` file before running app.py for the first time. 

Setup is much easier now! just docker compose and tweak all initial settings on the site.

The readme (and screenshots) will be updated soon.

# onboarderr
Self-hosted user onboarding site for Plex and Audiobookshelf server owners

# Introducing Onboarderr

![mainpage](https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr/blob/main/screenshots/mainpage.png)

![Customization Options](https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr/blob/main/screenshots/customexample.png)

Onboarderr is a customizable onboarding site for a host's Plex and (optional) Audiobookshelf servers. It includes user instructions, server highlights, and a basic admin dashboard.

It's not exactly plug and play, as there are some things to customize before sharing it with users. Might be a little janky.

Please read to the end!

#

As someone who's never made a website before, I wanted to: 

- Learn about HTML, CSS, websites in general, and self-hosting
- Improve on a few "new user setup" guides I've seen for Plex
- Offer a more appealing way for friends to join my Plex
- Give me something constructive to do while unemployed lol

Admittedly, most of the code was generated by AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor). 

I handled the layout, all copywriting/instructions, collected and edited screenshots, and came up with this whole thing.

Big thanks to [@mon5termatt](https://github.com/mon5termatt) for many of the improvements in v2

# Requirements

Docker or Python (3.10+)

Plex Media Server

Method of making your local server publicly accessible (Tailscale w/ [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) if you're new to self-hosting. Simple and free. I use [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/) now to handle a few local service URLs I want to make public)

# Optional Requirements

[Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) Server and public URL to share with users

[Pulsarr](https://github.com/jamcalli/Pulsarr) - Per-user content requests integrated w/ Sonarr & Radarr via Plex watchlist
- Pulsarr is able to push "media added" notifications through the Plex mobile app via Tautulli integration. Works fine for movies, but does not handle every new episode of shows.

[Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) - Per-user specific "episode/media item added" notifications on Discord
- If a user wants notifications for each new episode of a show, I create a new private text channel that is only for them on my discord server, then use the info for that channel in Tautulli for a new notification agent. Condition for the Show Name and it directs those notifs to the channel I just made.

[Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) & [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) - to grab the watchlisted content

Discord - to handle certain admin & user notifications

# First Time Setup

	git clone https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr

	cd onboarderr


# Dockerized Startup (Recommended)

From the project directory, choose one of the following options:

## Docker Compose (Recommended for Most Users)
A `compose.yml` file is included for use with Docker Compose.

Before running `docker compose up -d`, see below

### Mounting Drives for Storage Bars
To display storage bars for specific drives (e.g., E: and F: on Windows, or /mnt/e and /mnt/f on Linux), you must:

1. **Add volume mounts for each drive in your `compose.yml`** under the `volumes:` section:

- **Linux Example:**
  ```
  volumes:
    - .:/app
    - /mnt/e:/mnt/e
    - /mnt/f:/mnt/f
  ```
- **Windows Example:**
  ```
  volumes:
    - .:/app
    - E:\:/mnt/e
    - F:\:/mnt/f
  ```
2. **Set the `DRIVES` During setup or via variable in your `.env` file** to the mount points inside the container (e.g., `/mnt/e,/mnt/f`).

  > **Note:** On Windows, you may need to allow Docker Desktop access to your drives (Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > File Sharing).

## Manual Docker Run

### Linux/macOS:
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v $(pwd):/app onboarderr
```
To include mounted drives:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v /mnt/e:/mnt/e \
  -v /mnt/f:/mnt/f \
  onboarderr
```

### Windows (PowerShell):
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v ${PWD}:/app onboarderr
```
Mounted Drives version:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  -v ${PWD}:/app `
  -v E:\:/mnt/e `
  -v F:\:/mnt/f `
  onboarderr
```

### Windows (Command Prompt):
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v %cd%:/app onboarderr
```
Mounted Drives version:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr ^
  --restart unless-stopped ^
  -v %cd%:/app ^
  -v E:\:/mnt/e ^
  -v F:\:/mnt/f ^
  onboarderr
```

- **If you change the drives in `.env`, make sure your Docker volumes match!**
- The site will be available at `localhost:10000`

### Troubleshooting Docker Drive Mounts on Windows
- If you get errors about mounting drives, open Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > File Sharing and add the drives (e.g., `E:\`, `F:\`).
- Restart Docker Desktop after making changes.

# Restarting the App

- **After setup or changing settings, the app will automatically restart itself to apply changes.**
- You do **not** need to manually restart the container after setup or settings changes.
- If you ever need to restart manually (e.g., after updating code), use:
  - `docker restart onboarderr` (for Docker)
  - `CTRL+C` then `python app.py` again (for manual/venv use)

# Manual Startup

Create and activate a venv (conda or through system python), then:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python app.py

- It runs on port `10000` by default. You can change this near the top of `app.py`.
- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:10000`

# Setup Form

- First run will bring you to [/setup](https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr/blob/main/screenshots/1_setup.png). Everything here can be changed afterwards from ```.env``` or Settings on ```/services```.
- The library descriptions you write are saved to ```library_notes.json```, and displayed on the Plex onboarding page in section 1.
- It pulls artwork from your Plex libraries to show in the carousels. I have an audiobook library which mirrors my ABS server so it was easiest for me to just use Plex to pull those images instead of new logic for ABS.
- After submission, restart the script to apply the new ```.env``` and go to Login
- ```ADMIN_PASSWORD``` will take you to services page, but you can browse the others from the links at the top.
- ```SITE_PASSWORD``` will not allow access to admin page


# !!! Per-Host Tweaks !!!


<!-- NOTES
USE https://dashboardicons.com/icons FOr icons. 
https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/tree/main/webp has all icons. 
-->

After setup, go through the HTMLs and other files, and make any changes to the content to adjust it for you.

Specifically:

- ```onboarding_section7.html``` is personalized, you should change it to what you want it to say.
- Make a new logo, and wordmark. I made the ones it comes with quickly with these sites -
	- Simple vector editor - https://vectorink.io/app/canvas
   		- clearlogo is ```300x300```, favicon is ```32x32```
	- Wordmark Generator (make output text as big as slider allows) - https://fontmeme.com/netflix-font/
- If you don't have Tautulli + Discord set up, remove mentions of "ask me about my discord"
- Delete placeholder ```plex_submissions.json``` and ```audiobookshelf_submissions.json```. the ones that come with it have example data to populate the requests sections on ```/services```
  
# Sharing

When ready, 
- Activate your tailscale funnel, cloudflare tunnel, or bingle tube
- Share the public URL with friends

# Updates

Option 1:
```git pull``` will try to update the repo and notify you if there are any incompatible changes, like if your customizations will overlap with anything from the update

Option 2 - 

```
git stash	# temporarily saves your changes (html, css, etc)
git pull	# gets updates
git stash pop	# re-applies your changes on top
```

After updating, restart the container to make sure all new changes apply.

# Future goals

I've never made a project this complex, or had a project this many people were interested in, so I'm not clear on how the future development for this will go. I have some ideas to make it better, but getting this all set up in a way that it's customizable and not just for my machine only was a beast itself.

So if you want to make it better, please do! Fork, pull request, whatever.

Some improvements I might work on after publishing the initial version -

- Improve layout, make more modern/adaptive, especially on mobile. My CSS implementation of mobile device detection, and how it changes elements for mobile, is crude at the moment.
- More languages, maybe language dropdown on setup to switch all body text contents

# Thank You!

Thanks for your interest in my project! I hope you find it useful. If you want to give me a tip for putting this all together -
